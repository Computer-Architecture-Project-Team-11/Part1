# Advanced Computer Architecture Project -Part 1

1. Based on the contents of the `starter_se.py` file, assumptions regarding the characteristics that have been passed to gem5 after running the `HelloWorld` program can be made. More specifically:
   * **CPU Type = "atomic"** (the type of the cpu is defined in line 185:
      ```python
      parser.add_argument("--cpu", type=str, choices=list(cpu_types.keys()),
                        default="atomic"
      ```  
      The final value though is determined by the argument in the terminal command `--cpu="minor"`. This means that the cache classes are the ones defined in `starter_se.py` for the "minor" type.
   * **Operational Frequency = 1GHz** :
      ```python
      parser.add_argument("--cpu-freq", type=str, default="1GHz")
      ```  
   * **Number of Cores = 1**:
      ```python
        parser.add_argument("--num-cores", type=int, default=1,
                        help="Number of CPU cores")
       ```
   * **Memory Type = DDR3_1600_8x8**:
      ```python
      parser.add_argument("--mem-type", default="DDR3_1600_8x8",
                        choices=ObjectList.mem_list.get_names(),
                          help = "type of memory to use")
        ```  
   * **Number of Memory Channels = 2**:
       ```python
      parser.add_argument("--mem-channels", type=int, default=2,
                          help = "number of memory channels")
        ```  
   * **Number of Memory Ranks per Channel = 0**:
       ```python
      parser.add_argument("--mem-ranks", type=int, default=None,
                        help = "number of memory ranks per channel")
        ```  
   * **Memory Size = 2GB**:
       ```python
     parser.add_argument("--mem-size", action="store", type=str,
                        default="2GB",
                        help="Specify the physical memory size")
        ```  
2. The following are information dirived from the `stats.txt`, `config.ini` and `config.json` files after running this command:

        
           $ ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d hello_result configs/example/arm/starter_se.py --cpu="minor" "tests/test-progs/hello/bin/arm/linux/hello"
        

   a. 
      * Based on the `config.ini` file the cpu-type is "minor"
          ```
             [system.cpu_cluster.cpus]
             type=MinorCPU
          ```
         Although as mentioned in part 1. the default value, defined in `starter_se.py`, for the cpu-type is "atomic", the final value is determined by the argument in the above command `--cpu="minor"`.
      * from `statistics.txt` the operational frequency is 1GHZ as expected
         ```
          sim_freq                                 1000000000000                       # Frequency of simulated ticks
         ```
      * memory type
      * number of memory channels
      * from `config.ini` the number of memory ranks per channel is 2
         ```
          [system.mem_ctrls0]/[system.mem_ctrls1]
          ranks_per_channel=2
         ```
      * memory size

   b. 
      * sim_seconds: the time in seconds that the simulation needs for execution
      * sim_insts: the number of instructions that were simulated
      * host_inst_rate: the rate of instructions simulated per second

   c.  ```
       system.cpu_cluster.cpus.committedInsts           5027                       # Number of instructions committed
       ```

   d.  from `starter_se.py` and because the type of the CPU is "minor" the L2 Cache class is "devices.L2".
       The number of times that the L2 cache was accessed is equal to the muner of times L1 was accessed and a miss occured which is 147.
       ```
        system.cpu_cluster.cpus.branchPred.indirectMisses          147                       # Number of indirect misses.
        ```

   a. Commands for the `fibonacci.c` file:

      * MinorCPU
         ``` 
            $ ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d fib_results_MinorCPU configs/example/se.py --cpu-type=MinorCPU --caches -c tests/test-progs/hello/bin/arm/linux/fibonacci
          ```
      * TimingSimpleCPU
        ```
           $ ./build/ARM/gem5.opt -d fib_results_TimingSimpleCPU configs/example/se.py --cpu-type=TimingSimpleCPU --caches -c tests/test-progs/hello/bin/arm/linux/fibonacci
         ```
